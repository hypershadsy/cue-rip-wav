cue-rip-wav
===========

Extract sound tracks from bin/cue or iso/cue

It exports each track as a wav, even if it's a data track

Note
----
When I say "the binary", I mean the bin or the iso, whichever applies
When I say "the pair", I mean both the cue and the binary

How-to
-----
Run with `./cuerip.sh "thevideogame.cue"`

To-do
----
Fix not being able to find binary if the pair isn't in current directory
